        id="introduction">1. Introduction</h2>

    <p class="govuk-body">This page describes our approach to writing about ethnicity in the Race Disparity Unit (RDU).</p>
    
        <p class="govuk-body">It is not official government guidance.</p>

        <p class="govuk-body">We first published content on how we write about ethnicity in December 2018. It has remained largely the same since then.</p>

        <p class="govuk-body">This content is part of our style guide and is used mainly by people working on <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" 
                           href="{{ url_for("static_site.index").rstrip('/') }}">Ethnicity facts and figures</a>.</p>




    <h2 class="govuk-heading-l govuk-!-margin-top-4"
        id="ethnic-minorities-and-ethnic-groups">2. Ethnic minorities and ethnic groups</h2>


    <h3 class="govuk-heading-m"
        id="ethnicity-and-race">Ethnicity and race</h3>

    <p class="govuk-body">We refer to ethnicity and not race. This is because:</p>

    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>surveys usually ask people for their ethnicity and not their race</li>
      <li>using consistent terms helps people to understand our data</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 class="govuk-heading-m"
        id="ethnic-minorities">Ethnic minorities</h3>

    <p class="govuk-body">We use ‘ethnic minorities’ to refer to all ethnic groups except the White British group.
      Ethnic minorities
      include
      White minorities, such as Gypsy, Roma and Irish Traveller groups.</p>

    <p class="govuk-body">For comparisons with the White group as a whole, we use ‘all other ethnic groups combined’ or
      ‘ethnic minorities
      (excluding White minorities)’. We also refer to ‘White’ and ‘Other than White’ if space is limited.</p>

    <p class="govuk-body">We do not use ‘Non-White’ because defining groups in relation to the White majority was not
      well received in user
      research.</p>

    
    <h3 class="govuk-heading-m"
        id="broad-and-specific-ethnic-groups">Broad and specific ethnic groups</h3>

    <p class="govuk-body">We avoid using ‘broad’ and ‘specific’ when referring to ethnic groups. For example, the ‘broad
      Asian group’ or
      the ‘specific Pakistani group’. This is because these terms aren’t widely used outside of data collection.</p>

    <p class="govuk-body">If we need to, we refer to either ‘aggregated’ ethnic groups or ethnic groups ‘as a whole’. For example, ‘the Black ethnic group as a whole’.</p>

    <h3 class="govuk-heading-m"
        id="phrasing">Phrasing</h3>

    <p class="govuk-body">In research, ‘people from a Black Caribbean background’, ‘the Black ethnic group’ and ‘Black
      people’ were all
      acceptable phrases. ‘Blacks’ was not.</p>

    <p class="govuk-body">Similarly ‘people from a White British background’, ‘the White ethnic group’ and ‘White
      people’ are all
      acceptable.
    </p>

    <p class="govuk-body">However, we don’t say ‘Mixed people’ or ‘Mixed race people’. We usually say ‘people with a Mixed ethnic background’ or ‘people from the Mixed ethnic group’.</p>

    <h3 class="govuk-heading-m"
        id="gypsy-roma-and-traveller-ethnic-groups">Gypsy, Roma and Traveller ethnic groups</h3>

    <p class="govuk-body">‘Gypsy or Irish Traveller’ is one of the <a class="govuk-link"
         rel="external"
         href="{{ url_for('static_site.style_guide_ethnic_groups').rstrip('/') }}">18 standardised ethnic groups</a>.
      We differentiate between Gypsy, Roma and Irish Traveller communities if data is collected for them separately.</p>

    <p class="govuk-body">We don’t use slashes (/) in commentary as this can imply these terms are the same. Instead we
      refer to:</p>

    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>‘the White Gypsy and Roma ethnic group’ or ‘White Gypsy and Roma people’</li>
      <li>‘the White Gypsy and Irish Traveller ethnic group’ or ‘White Gypsy and Irish Traveller people’</li>
    </ul>

    
     <h2 class="govuk-heading-l govuk-!-margin-top-4"
        id="bame-and-bme">3. BAME and BME</h2>

    <p class="govuk-body">There is not a consistent approach across government to the terms:</p>
    
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>BAME (Black, Asian and minority ethnic)</li>
      <li>BME (Black and minority ethnic)</li>
    </ul>

    
        <p class="govuk-body">In the RDU, we publish data on all ethnic groups on our website. We do not use the terms BAME and BME because they emphasise certain ethnic minority groups (Asian and Black) and exclude others (Mixed, Other and White ethnic minority groups).</p>

    
        <p class="govuk-body">In our user research with members of the public in July 2018, no participants knew what the terms meant. This research was about our website, rather than the term BAME and its political and social aspects.</p>
    
            <p class="govuk-body">In March 2021, the Commission on Race and Ethnic Disparities recommended that the government stop using the term BAME. The government is currently considering its response to <a class="govuk-link"
         rel="external"
         href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-report-of-the-commission-on-race-and-ethnic-disparities/foreword-introduction-and-full-recommendations#full-recommendations">the Commission's 24 recommendations</a>.</p>


   

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-l govuk-!-margin-top-9"
        id="ordering-and-style">4. Ordering and style</h2>

    <h3 class="govuk-heading-m"
        id="capitalisation">Capitalisation</h3>

    <p class="govuk-body">We capitalise all ethnic groups. For example, Asian, Black, Mixed, White, Gypsy, Irish
      Traveller, and Other.</p>

    <p class="govuk-body">This is because:</p>

    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>ethnic groups such as Asian and Indian start with a capital letter so this maintains a consistent approach for all groups
      </li>
      <li>it makes our content easier to read if we’re comparing ‘the Other ethnic group’ with other ethnic groups</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="govuk-body">For this reason we write, for example, ‘people from the Asian Other ethnic
      group’. This is despite
      the
      fact the category is usually ‘Any other Asian background’.</p>

    <h3 class="govuk-heading-m"
        id="order-of-ethnic-categories">Order of ethnic categories</h3>

    <p class="govuk-body">Ethnic groups are ordered alphabetically in charts and tables, with ‘Other’, and
      occasionally
      ‘Unknown’, as
      a final category.</p>

    <p class="govuk-body">In user research, some people were offended when White was placed first in a list of ethnic groups, while others did not like inconsistent ordering.</p>

    <h3 class="govuk-heading-m govuk-!-margin-top-9"
        id="ethnicities-and-nationalities">Ethnicities and nationalities</h3>

    <p class="govuk-body">These ethnic groups are also nationalities:</p>

    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>Bangladeshi</li>
      <li>Chinese</li>
      <li>Indian</li>
      <li>Pakistani</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="govuk-body">If there’s a risk of users mistaking ethnicities for nationalities, we avoid ambiguity by
      writing:</p>

    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>‘people from the Indian ethnic group’, not ‘Indian people’</li>
      <li>‘pupils from the Chinese ethnic group’, not ‘Chinese pupils’</li>
    </ul>
