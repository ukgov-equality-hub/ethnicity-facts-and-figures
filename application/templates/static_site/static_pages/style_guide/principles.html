        id="write-clearly-and-concisely">1. Write clearly and concisely</h2>

    <p class="govuk-body">When we write for the Ethnicity facts and figures website and GOV.UK, it should:</p>

    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>meet user needs</li>
      <li>be clear and concise</li>
      <li>be written in plain English</li>
      <li>be easy for everyone to understand, even complex statistical ideas</li>
      <li>be accessible to everyone, including people with disabilities or who use assistive technologies like screen
        readers</li>
      <li>follow our guidelines on <a class="govuk-link"
           href="{{ url_for('static_site.style_guide_writing_about_ethnicity').rstrip('/') }}">writing about
          ethnicity</a> and <a class="govuk-link"
           href="{{ url_for('static_site.style_guide_a_z').rstrip('/') }}">our
          style guide A to Z</a></li>
    </ul>

    <p class="govuk-body">GOV.UK has <a class="govuk-link"
         rel="external"
         href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/content-design/writing-for-gov-uk">guidance on
        how to write well</a>.
    </p>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-l govuk-!-margin-top-9"
        id="be-impartial-and-avoid-judgemental-language">2. Be impartial and avoid judgemental language</h2>

    <p class="govuk-body">We do not explain ethnic disparities shown in the data. We just show the data in a way that can be understood by the widest possible audience.</p>

    <p class="govuk-body">We avoid judgemental words like 'only', 'best' and 'worst'.</p>

  <p class="govuk-body">This is judgemental:</p>

    <div class="govuk-inset-text">in every ethnic group, girls did better in their English and Maths GCSE than boys –
      67% of girls achieved grades A* to C, compared with only 59% of boys
    </div>
    
    <p class="govuk-body">This is neutral:</p>

    <div class="govuk-inset-text">in every ethnic group, girls (67%) were more likely to achieve A* to C in English and Maths GCSE than boys (59%)
    </div>

    

    <p class="govuk-body">We refer to ethnic disparities rather than ethnic discrimination. This is because differences in outcomes between ethnic groups are not always the result of discrimination.</p>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-l govuk-!-margin-top-9"
        id="explain-if-figures-arent-reliable">3. Explain if figures are unreliable</h2>

    <p class="govuk-body">Charts and tables can appear to show findings which, for statistical reasons, are unreliable. Ignoring them leaves readers confused or even suspicious.</p>

    <p class="govuk-body">We explain if findings are unreliable.</p>

    <p class="govuk-body">For example:</p>

    <div class="govuk-inset-text">for higher honours, the percentage of recipients from ethnic minorities is often based on small numbers – this makes it difficult to make reliable generalisations about changes over time
    </div>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-l govuk-!-margin-top-9"
        id="define-terms">4. Define terms</h2>

    <p class="govuk-body">We include definitions of terms we think readers may not know. We do this the first time we
      use the term.</p>

    <p class="govuk-body">For example:</p>

    <div class="govuk-inset-text">22% of working age people (people aged 16 to 64) were economically inactive in 2018,
      which means they were out of work and not looking for a job
    </div>

    <div class="govuk-inset-text">in the 2 years to March 2019, an average of 17% of households in England lived in a home with no modern facilities, no effective insulation or heating, or in a state of disrepair (a ‘non-decent home’)
    </div>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-l govuk-!-margin-top-9"
        id="dont-overload-users-with-numbers">5. Don’t overload users with numbers</h2>

    <p class="govuk-body">We don’t reference too many figures in one sentence. This is because it makes it harder for people to understand the information. The Nielson Norman Group have done <a class="govuk-link"
         rel="external"
         href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/minimize-cognitive-load/">research into how users process
        information</a>.</p>

    <p class="govuk-body">For example:</p>

    <div class="govuk-inset-text">4.6 million (20%) of the 23 million households in England rented their home from a
      private landlord in the 2 years from 2016 to 2018
    </div>

    <p class="govuk-body">This could be rewritten as:</p>

    <div class="govuk-inset-text">20% of households in England rented their home from a private landlord in the 2  years to March 2018
    </div>

    <p class="govuk-body">We minimise the number of figures used in one sentence.</p>

    <p class="govuk-body">We are consistent in the way we present figures – for example, we usually use percentages (20%), not fractions (one-fifth) or other alternatives ('one in five').</p>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-l govuk-!-margin-top-9"
        id="avoid-ambiguity">6. Avoid ambiguity</h2>

    <p class="govuk-body">We avoid ambiguity, especially when comparing ethnic groups.</p>

    <p class="govuk-body">For example, the phrase ‘across all ethnic groups’ can mean ‘in every ethnic group’ or ‘in
      total’.</p>

    <p class="govuk-body">Instead, we say ‘in every ethnic group’ if a finding applies to every ethnic group. We refer to ‘all other ethnic groups combined’ if data is shown for 2 ethnic groups – White, and all other groups combined.
</p>

    <p class="govuk-body">For example:</p>

    <div class="govuk-inset-text">between 2004 and 2018, the employment rate increased in every ethnic group</p>
    </div>
  
  <div class="govuk-inset-text">77% of White people were employed, compared with 65% of people from all other ethnic groups combined</p>
    </div>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-l govuk-!-margin-top-9"
        id="help-us-stay-up-to-date">7. Help us stay up to date</h2>

    <p class="govuk-body">We want to make sure our content reflects changes in language usage and acceptability over time.</p>
