    <p class="govuk-body">This statement was first published on 11 September 2020. It was last reviewed and updated on 25 October 2021.</p>

    <p class="govuk-body">This website was tested by the Digital Accessibility Centre (DAC) in July 2019.</p>

    <p class="govuk-body">Since this accessibility audit, we have:</p>
    
       <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>added 3 ethnic group summary pages which  give an overview of ethnicity data for specific ethnic groups</li>
            <li>added a new section with 4 pages about understanding our data</li>
      <li>removed a functional component on our data pages that meant users had to click to show and hide some content in the 'Main facts and figures' section</li>
     </ul>

      <p class="govuk-body">These changes were tested in October 2021 by the Equality Hub digital team using:</p>

            <li>the VoiceOver screen reader</li>

     </ul>
