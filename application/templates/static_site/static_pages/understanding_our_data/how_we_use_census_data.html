    <h1 class="govuk-heading-xl">How we use Census data</h1>


    <p class="govuk-body">Most of our figures on the UK population come from Census data. This includes population
      statistics for England and Wales, and age and gender data for different ethnic groups.</p>

    <p class="govuk-body">We also use Census data to:</p>

    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>work out rates on some of our data pages – for example, our stop and search data shows the stop and search
        rate per 1,000 people for every ethnic group</li>
      <li>act as a comparator – for example, our NHS workforce data compares the ethnic groups that make up the NHS
        workforce with the overall working age population</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-l"
        id="problems-using-census-data">Problems using Census data</h2>

    <p class="govuk-body">Using Census data can be problematic because:</p>

    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
   <li>ethnicity categories are usually updated every Census, so datasets that use the 2001 Census ethnic categories
        have to be altered so they match more recent categories
      </li>
      <li>population figures for each area only include permanent residents and not visitors</li>
    </ul>


    <div class="govuk-inset-text">
      <p class="govuk-body govuk-!-font-weight-bold">Example:</p>

      <p>In our data on the school teacher workforce, the ethnic groups follow the 2001 Census classification. However, the 2011
        Census moved 'Chinese' from the ‘Any Other’ ethnic group to ‘Asian/Asian British’. This means that figures using
        2011 Census categories can’t be compared with any using 2001 Census categories for 'Any Other' and 'Asian’.</p>
