    <h1 class="govuk-heading-xl">How to read survey data</h1>

    <p class="govuk-body">Some of our data comes from surveys. Surveys take responses from a sample of people rather than the
      whole group. </p>

    <p class="govuk-body">For example, a survey might ask 10% of parents their opinion on changing the curriculum rather
      than asking all parents.</p>

    <p class="govuk-body">The quality of survey data depends on:</p>

    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>how people were selected</li>
      <li>the number of people surveyed (the ‘sample size’)</li>
      <li>how the questions were asked</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="govuk-body">Once survey data has been collected and processed, analysts can use techniques to make it more representative or assess how reliable the sample is.</p>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-l"
        id="how-surveys-are-completed">How surveys are completed</h2>


    <p class="govuk-body">The method of a survey can affect the accuracy of the answers given, influencing results.</p>

<p class="govuk-body">People are usually more honest when completing surveys about sensitive topics without an interviewer present, for example when giving details about smoking or drinking.</p>

<p class="govuk-body">People are also more likely to make mistakes when responding to online or paper surveys. This is less likely with face-to-face or phone surveys because people can ask for things to be repeated.</p>

	  <p class="govuk-body">People sometimes give inaccurate answers to surveys because they do not remember past events or experiences well. This is known as ‘recall bias’. For example, people do not always accurately remember what they ate – this can affect the results of surveys into <a class="govuk-link"
	                   href="{{ url_for('static_site.measure_version',
	                                  topic_slug='health',
	                                  subtopic_slug='diet-and-exercise',
	                                  measure_slug='healthy-eating-of-5-a-day-among-adults',
	    version='latest') }}">healthy eating among adults</a>.</p>





    <h2 class="govuk-heading-l"
        id="weighting">Making survey data more representative</h2>

    <p class="govuk-body">Different techniques can be used to make survey data more representative of the whole group,
      and to assess the reliability of estimates and differences.</p>

    <p class="govuk-body">‘Weighting’ adjusts the results of a survey so they better represent the whole group.</p>

    <p class="govuk-body">A survey of 25 women and 75 men may not reflect the views of the general population (which is
      50% men, 50% women). </p>

    <p class="govuk-body">Analysts can ‘weight’ the results to more accurately represent the split of men and women in
      the general population.</p>

    <p class="govuk-body">Survey weights help to make sure the survey sample has broadly the same gender, age, ethnic
      and geographic proportions as the general population.</p>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-l"
        id="confidence-intervals">Confidence intervals</h2>

    <p class="govuk-body">A confidence interval is a range of values that the 'true' value for the whole group is highly
      likely to lie within. The estimate is the central point of this range.</p>

    <div class="govuk-inset-text">
      <p class="govuk-body govuk-!-font-weight-bold">Example:</p>
      <p>Data from 2018 shows that 15.0% of white adults smoked cigarettes. This is an estimate based on a sample of around 135,000 people. The 'true' figure was very likely to be between 14.7% and 15.2% – the upper and lower bounds of the confidence interval.</p>
    </div>

    <p class="govuk-body">A confidence interval of 95% means if we took 100 random samples, the estimate would fall
      within its upper and lower bounds 95 times. Confidence intervals of 90% and 99% are also sometimes used.</P>

    <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Using confidence intervals</h3>

    <p class="govuk-body">The wider the confidence interval, the less reliable the estimate. Wide confidence intervals
      can be the result of small samples, or large variation within survey responses.</P>

 <div class="govuk-inset-text">
      <p class="govuk-body govuk-!-font-weight-bold">Example:</p>
      <p>Data from 2018 shows that 7.7% of adults from the Chinese ethnic group smoked cigarettes, based on a sample of 729 people. There is greater uncertainty about the estimate because of the small sample size. This is reflected in a wider confidence interval, of between 4.9% and 10.5%.</p>
    </div>

    <p class="govuk-body">Confidence intervals can be used to find out if differences between the statistics for 2 groups are meaningful, for example differences between 2 ethnic groups or 2 time periods.</P>

    <p class="govuk-body">Differences are meaningful ('statistically significant') if the confidence intervals for the 2
      sets of statistics don't overlap, meaning they don't have any values in common. If they overlap, this shows that
      the difference in the 2 estimates is not meaningful. This means the findings cannot tell us if the difference
      found in the sample is also shown in the whole population.</P>


<h2 class="govuk-heading-l"
        id="combining-multiple-years-of-data">Combining multiple years of data</h2>

    <p class="govuk-body">We sometimes combine multiple years of data to make sure estimates are reliable. We might do this if the number of people surveyed in a single year was small.</p>

    <div class="govuk-inset-text">
      <p class="govuk-body govuk-!-font-weight-bold">Example:</p>
      <p>Our estimates for <a class="govuk-link"
	                   href="{{ url_for('static_site.measure_version',
	                                  topic_slug='work-pay-and-benefits',
	                                  subtopic_slug='pay-and-income',
	                                  measure_slug='pensioner-income',
	    version='latest') }}">pensioner income</a> are based on 3 years of data. The percentages shown are an average for a 3-year period.</p>
    </div>

    <p class="govuk-body">Estimates are updated every year, which means time periods will overlap. For example, data from April 2016 to March 2017 appears in the 3-year averages for:</p>

 <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>April 2014 to March 2017</li>
      <li>April 2015 to March 2018</li>
      <li>April 2016 to March 2019</li>
    </ul>


    <p class="govuk-body">We advise against comparing data for time periods that overlap. This is because the samples are not separate from each other – some of the people surveyed are the same.</p>

    <p class="govuk-body">Estimates based on multiple years of data can be tested for significance so we know that differences are reliable. For example, we can test for differences between ethnic groups within the same time period. We can also test for significance across time periods that do not overlap.</p>

    <p class="govuk-body">If significance testing cannot be done, we only comment on differences that are large enough to be reliable.</p>
